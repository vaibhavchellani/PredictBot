# PredictBot

**PredictBot** is simply a bot which helps bring the power of prediction markets to general audience.

We have integrated Augur and Gnosis like functionality using Toshi Bot .

We have integrated a Futarchy Model as a demo but you can create a prediction model around any question you can think of .

**What are Prediction Markets ?**

**Prediction markets** (also known as **predictive markets** , **information markets** , **decision markets** , **idea futures** , **event derivatives** , or **virtual markets** ) are exchange-traded markets created for the purpose of trading the outcome of events. The market prices can indicate what the crowd thinks the probability of the event is. A prediction market contract trades between 0 and 100%. It is a binary option that will expire at the price of 0 or 100%.

Prediction markets are better than surveys , machine learning models and other techniques used to know how people think about a certain question.

Prediction Markets gives the user the ability to create value from knowledge or intuition . It discourages people who have no or less knowledge from spreading influence over general audience as there is a value attached to a vote and people may actually lose or gain huge amounts of money.

**Futarchy Governance**

Knowing what exactly futarchy is essential to appreciate our effort :)

Futarchy: **Vote Values, But Bet Beliefs**

Why Futarchy and not Democracy ?

Democracy: Value of a vote doesn&#39;t depend on how much the policy affects you. The people who are affected most are often not able to represent themselves as their vote has the same value as that of a person who is not affected by a certain decision.

Futarchy: Futarchy offers an alternative way, by tying the individual&#39;s self-interest to an ethical utility function that we seek to maximise. The result is that only people with genuine beliefs will bet, due to their intrinsic self-interest, and now suddenly, the evil that plagues democracy, which is self-interest, is now harnessed into maximising the utility function! In a futarchy people get to choose what they want, but the markets decide how to achieve this.

Lets take an example In india a bill gets proposed and before becoming a law it becomes a topic of discussion among the general public , experts and media . But those are just talks ! Some political parties are able to generate a hype and swoop the masses with their glorified talks while experts keep telling what is really going on .

In a futarchy governance because it costs to bet only people who have adequate knowledge would bet and this would create a more educated poll rather than the one generated by asking random people. People can bet on multiple markets simultaneously , it helps project the GDP prices after the bill becomes a law and helps government in deciding if the bill should become a law or not .

This model can be used for DAO governance as well

**What does this Bot do ?**

- We have integrated the &quot;Futarchy Model of Governance &quot; proposed by Robin Hanson in the form of a bot .
- People can bet on upcoming/pending bills and gain rewards for predicting correctly .
- If a bill affects a certain person more than a second person he/she can bet more money to show stronger vote .
- Currently we have only considered financial bills , we have taken the bills from the official site of indian government ( [http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/](http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/))
- People get paid 6 months after the bill becomes the law , we track the result from the website given above and observe the change in GDP to determine results. (partially implemented )
- Government can bet against people and if they win they can use the funds obtained from the market for other projects .(Hedging)
- People can create their own prediction markets around any question and participate in them .
